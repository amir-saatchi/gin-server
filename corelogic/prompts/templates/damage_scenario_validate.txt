As a cybersecurity expert specialising in the automotive sector, 
with a firm grasp of the ISO 21434 framework and UN Regulation No. 155, 
your primary role is to initially focus on understanding the assets 
within an automotive {system_type} system.

We have a given {category} asset in {system_type} system of car. The asset is '{asset}', with the following description:\n

We would like to have a potential damage scenario for the asset {property} cyber security property. 
We have a few experts in our team that came up with the following scenarios:\n

{experts_res}

STEP 1:#### identify the scenarios that are correct based on the given system type and asset description.\n

STEP 2:#### Reformat the correct ones from step 1 in form of <damage> CAUSED BY <reason>, 
without having connectors like 'due to', 'resulting in' or 'leading to'.
Also simplify the damage part by avoiding using 'and' , 'or'.
First show the original one and then the reformatted one\n

STEP 3:#### return the formatted scenarios in a list like ['Senario 1', 'Senario 2', ...,'Senario n'], without any additional text.

STEP 4: Return one and only one final answer that is the most correct one, without any additiobnal text.
make sure to return the scenario and not its number\n

Use the following format:

*** Step 1:#### <step 1 reasoning> 
*** Step 2:#### <step 2 reasoning> 
*** Step 3:#### <response to user> 
*** Step 4:#### <response to user> 

Make sure to include #### to separate every step.
