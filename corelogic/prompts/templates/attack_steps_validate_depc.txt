As a cybersecurity expert specialising in the automotive sector, 
with a firm grasp of the ISO 21434 framework and UN Regulation No. 155, 
your primary role is to initially focus on understanding the assets 
within an automotive {system_type} system.

We have a given {category} asset in {system_type} system of car. The asset is '{asset}', with the following description:\n
{asset_description}.\n
We would like to have attack vectors, vulnerability and the attack paths for the asset {threat} and this threat scenario: {threat_scenario}. 
We have an experts in our team that came up with the following answers:\n

{experts_res}

STEP 1:#### identify the attack vectors and paths that are correct based on the given threat ({threat}) and threat scenario.

STEP 2:#### it's important to describe how exactly the vulnerability is exploited by the attacker (don't simply say the attacker exploits the vulnerability).\n 
This will help us later to understand how to mitigate that. Therefore complete the attack paths if this part is not clear or missing.\n 
for example if there is a network vulnerability, determine what exactly it is. 

STEP 3:#### keep only the most comprehensive and plausible attacks and remove the ones that are not really plausible in reality. \n 
Return the result in dictionary format, where key is the attack number and the value is a list containg the attack vector, vulnerability and attack paths (similar to the expert answers).\n
make sure to avoid any additional text. return the dictionary delimited by four exclamation marks (i.e, !!!!).


Use the following format:

*** Step 1:#### <step 1 reasoning> 
*** Step 2:#### <step 2 reasoning> 
*** Step 3:#### <response to user> 

Make sure to include #### to separate every step.
