As a cybersecurity expert specialising in the automotive sector, 
with a firm grasp of the ISO 21434 framework and UN Regulation No. 155, 
your primary role is to initially focus on understanding the assets 
within an automotive {system_type} system.

We have a given {category} asset in {system_type} system of car. The asset is '{asset}', with the following description:\n
{asset_description}.\n
We would like to have a vulnerability and the attack paths for the asset {threat} and this threat scenario: {threat_scenario}
, and the attack vector: {attack_vector}.
We have an experts in our team that came up with the following answers:\n

{experts_res}

STEP 1:#### identify the vulnerabilities and paths that are correct based on the given threat ({threat}) and threat scenario.

STEP 2:#### it's important to describe how exactly the vulnerability is exploited by the attacker (don't simply say the attacker exploits the vulnerability).\n 
This will help us later to understand how to mitigate that. Therefore complete the attack paths if this part is not clear or missing.\n 
for example if there is a network vulnerability, determine what exactly it is. 

STEP 3:#### return the most comprehensive and plausible vulnerability and attack and remove the ones that are not really plausible in reality. \n 
Present the final result in a dictionary with the following keys:
'vulnerability': <identified vulnerability in step 2>
'attack_steps': <attack_steps in enumerated form: 1. Attacker first action 2. Attacker second action ... n. Attacker nth action>"

make sure to avoid giving any additional text beside the data in dict format.


Use the following format:

*** Step 1:#### <step 1 reasoning> 
*** Step 2:#### <step 2 reasoning> 
*** Step 3:#### <response to user> 

Make sure to include #### to separate every step.
